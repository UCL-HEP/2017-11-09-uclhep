This directory contains a script for testing your machine to make sure
you have the software you'll need for your workshop installed.  To use
these scripts:

1.  Download [swc-installation-test-hep.py](swc-installation-test-hep.py).

2.  Run it from the shell:

    ~~~
    $ python swc-installation-test-hep.py
    check command line shell (virtual-shell)...	pass
    check text/code editor (virtual-editor)...	pass
    ...
    Successes:

    virtual-shell Bourne Again Shell (bash) 4.2.37
    ...
    ~~~

    If you see anything listed under Failures, you can try to install any
    missing software, but please let us know if you are unable to do this
    or unsure how to go about it.
